                    Life teaches you to always expect the unexpected and hearing those not only does it excites me 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    but also the anticipation of other feelings as well. Ever heard of the saying <i>"when life gives you lemons, 
                    <br>
                    <br>make lemonade".</i> Always make every minute of your life worth living and spend it on making 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    beautiful memories with those around you. I solely believe that each and every one of us is brought to this 
                    <br>
                    <br>world for a reason and we are meant to cross paths with others. So let's live our <b>Lives</b> to the fullest,
                    <br>
                    <br> be our very own main character in <b>Life</b> and enjoy the rollercoaster we called <b>Life!</b></div>

                    <div class="text"> <br>Hello there, everyone! I'm Serena Hani Marizam! and here's a little sneak glimpse at me ;) </div>
                        <br>
                        <p>I was blessed with the name of <b>Serena Hani Marizam</b> and like any other child,
                        <br>I would question my mother how did she came up with the name. well that's another story to tell but overall I really adore my name because it was inspired by the
                        <br>character Serena van der Woodsen from the popular TV programme Gossip Girl. I have not yet to see the series in which Blake Lively stars and the well known tennis player, Serena Williams (I, too, do not know how to play tennis) I have yet to reach their achievement of fame and success but in my own quirky way I believe I have reached my own milestones in life. Of course, there will be more achievements for me to make, but I'm very grateful for those that have already been made.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I am a Libra who was born on the 5th of October 2001 at Ipoh Perak but grew up in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. Currently, residing in Ampang Jaya, Selangor with my lovely mother and 5 siblings. I'm the second oldest among of five siblings and as a sister I would describe myself as very stern and strict on my younger siblings.
                        <br>The bond that I have with my family is a very close one and I would never trade the relationship for anything. My hobby has me working extremely hard and sweating immensely! Cheerleading, badminton, takraw and frisbee are some of my favourite sports. I've been a cheerleader since I was in standard 3 of primary school and continued cheering up until form 5 of high school but I had to stop due to my back injury. Despite this, I enjoy cheering because it allows me to show my support and love to others.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>My attitude is greatly influenced by my surrounding; for example, blue skies and fluffy clouds makes me really happy all day. I can be both of an introvert and extrovert depending on who I'm around. I'm shy around new people, but once I get close I could be the loudest person in the group :) People have often mistaken me as a Chinese or a Sabahan due to my small, squinty eyes, which bear some resemblance to them. The amount of times I have told people "no lah I'm not Chinese, 
                        <br>I'm purely Malay!" is a lot and I would typically just agree to strangers that I am. With majority of people calling me Serena, it really didn't help with the case. I had to introduce myself as Hani when I first arrived at university since I didn't want to cause further confusion! However, people still do believe I'm a mixed blood. 
                        <br>The replies I got when I told them I'm Malay were rather amusing; the number of doubts about my race could have made me a millionaire today!
                        <br>Most people's first perceptions of me were of a cold, arrogant and snobbish girl but after spending some time with me, I absolutely surprised them. My friends describe 
                        <br>me as a nice person that would go out of her way to help people in need and will protect her love ones the most. And I couldn't agree with them more! I'd describe myself as a simple person who enjoys small things that brings me definite happiness. Trivial acts makes me laugh and I appreciate spreading positive energy around me.

                         <p>From the age of 5 to 6, I attended Smart Reader Kids, and from the age of 7 to 12,
                         <br>
                         <br>I attended SK Convent Bukit Nanas in <abbr title="Kuala Lumpur">KL.</abbr> This was the 
                         <br>
                         <br>beginning of an incredible journey for me in an all-girls school.</p>

                         <p>From the age of 13 to 17, I continued my studies at SMK Convent Bukit Nanas.
                         <br>
                         <br>This is where I began to blossom and develop my own personality and identity. Studying
                         <br>
                         <br>at an all-girls school has ingrained in me a number of principles that girls and women
                         <br>
                         <br>should aspire to.Every woman should strive for their own beliefs, strength and confidence.
                         <br>
                         <br>My high school years taught me that self-love, empowerment, and equality should always be 
                         <br>
                         <br>alive and active within ourselves and those around us.</p>
